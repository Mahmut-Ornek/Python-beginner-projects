This repository contains a collection of 12 Python projects inspired by the video tutorial: [12 Beginner Python Projects](https://youtu.be/8ext9G7xspg?feature=shared). Each project is designed to reinforce fundamental programming concepts while building practical applications.

## **Projects Overview**

### 1. Mad Libs Generator

A simple word replacement game that takes user input to create funny sentences.

### 2. Number Guessing Game

A game where the user guesses a randomly generated number with hints provided.

### 3. Rock, Paper, Scissors

A command-line implementation of the classic game against the computer.

### 4. Password Generator

A script that generates secure passwords with random characters.

### 5. Dice Rolling Simulator

Simulates rolling dice with random number generation.

### 6. QR Code Generator

Generates a QR code from user input (e.g., a URL or text).

### 7. Calculator

A basic calculator with addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### 8. To-Do List App

A command-line to-do list that allows users to add, remove, and mark tasks as complete.

### 9. Countdown Timer

A timer that counts down from a specified number of seconds.

### 10. Binary Search Algorithm

A demonstration of the binary search algorithm for searching sorted lists.

### 11. Web Scraper

Extracts information from a website using BeautifulSoup.

### 12. Text-Based Markov Chain Generator *(Connected to Your Code)*

A program that generates text based on probability mappings of words in a given input. This is similar to the `compose.py` and `graph.py` scripts in this repository, which use a Markov chain approach to generate text compositions.
