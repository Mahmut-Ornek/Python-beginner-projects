# README: Python Project Collection

Improve your Python skills by following along with 12 different Python project tutorials: [12 Beginner Python Projects](https://youtu.be/8ext9G7xspg?feature=shared). Each project is designed to reinforce fundamental programming concepts while building practical applications. ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

## **Projects Overview**

### 1. Mad Libs
A simple word replacement game that takes user input to create funny sentences.

### 2. Guess the Number (Computer)
A game where the computer randomly selects a number, and the user attempts to guess it with feedback provided.

### 3. Guess the Number (User)
A game where the user picks a number, and the computer tries to guess it using binary search logic.

### 4. Rock, Paper, Scissors
A command-line implementation of the classic game against the computer.

### 5. Hangman
A word-guessing game where the player tries to guess the word before running out of attempts.

### 6. Tic-Tac-Toe
A two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Python.

### 7. Tic-Tac-Toe AI
An AI-powered version of Tic-Tac-Toe where the player competes against an intelligent computer opponent.

### 8. Binary Search Algorithm
A demonstration of the binary search algorithm for searching sorted lists efficiently.

### 9. Minesweeper
A text-based version of the classic Minesweeper game.

### 10. Sudoku Solver
A program that automatically solves Sudoku puzzles using backtracking algorithms.

### 11. Photo Manipulation in Python
A project demonstrating how to manipulate images using Python libraries like Pillow or OpenCV.

### 12. Markov Chain Text Composer *(Connected to Your Code)*
A program that generates text based on probability mappings of words in a given input. This is similar to the `compose.py` and `graph.py` scripts in this repository, which use a Markov chain approach to generate text compositions.

## Running the Markov Chain Project

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed and the necessary dependencies.

### Usage
1. Place a text file in the `texts/` directory (e.g., `hp_sorcerer_stone.txt`).
2. Run `compose.py` to generate a random text composition:
   ```bash
   python compose.py
   ```
3. The script will process the text, build a word graph, and generate a probabilistic sequence of words.
